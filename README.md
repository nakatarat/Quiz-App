# Quiz-App
A client-side quiz app made with Vanilla JavaScript. It uses the Fetch API to grab JSON data from the local quiz.json file.

My submission for the App Developer entrance project.

To run:

Launch index.html through a local development server.
I used Visual Studio Code's Live Server extension.
